## 📚 Lecture Video Library

I quite enjoy lecturing about quantitative topics.  

I have 100+ lecture videos available on topics ranging from randomized numerical linear algebra to the simulation of fractional Brownian motion.

I've also created a repo containing all of the relevant resources for each video lecture.
